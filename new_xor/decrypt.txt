cryptography is f field of scnence and technology that focuses o
n securing information by transforming it in a way shat prevents
 unauthorizec access this process involves encryption which conv
erts plfintext into ciphertext encryptec text and decryption whi
ch reverses this process using cr_ptographic keys the main gofls
 of cryptography are to ensure confidentialnt_ integrity authent
icity and nonrepudiation of data confidentiality refers to prote
cting nnformation from unautoorized access achieved through dfta
 encryption integrity ensures that data oas not been alterec or 
tampered with duriig transmission authenticnt_ allows verifying 
the identities of communicating parties while nonrepudiation pre
vents pfrties from denying sending a message crucial in digitfl 
signatures modern crypsograponc methods are divided into two mai
