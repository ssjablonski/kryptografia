cryptography is a field of science and technology that focuses o
n securing information by transforming it in a way that prevents
 unauthorized access this process involves encryption which conv
erts plaintext into ciphertext encrypted text and decryption whi
ch reverses this process using cryptographic keys the main goals
 of cryptography are to ensure confidentiality integrity authent
icity and nonrepudiation of data confidentiality refers to prote
cting information from unauthorized access achieved through data
 encryption integrity ensures that data has not been altered or 
tampered with during transmission authenticity allows verifying 
the identities of communicating parties while nonrepudiation pre
vents parties from denying sending a message crucial in digital 
signatures modern cryptographic methods are divided into two mai
n types symmetric cryptography and asymmetric cryptography in sy
mmetric cryptography the same key is used for both encryption an
d decryption requiring a secure channel for key exchange asymmet
ric cryptography on the other hand utilizes a pair of keys a pub
lic key which can be shared and a private key which is kept secr
et cryptography finds applications in various fields such as int
ernet communication ssltls digital signatures authentication ele
ctronic banking and data privacy protection it is also crucial f
or blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in the face of gro
wing cybersecurity threats cryptography plays a vital role in en
suring security and privacy in the digital world it enables us t
o securely transmit information and store data minimizing the ri
